Since finishing secondary school I've been in love with computer scinece, inlduing coding, software developement, and leaning about computer hardware. 
Once I have finsihed my studies in college I have been teaching myself about software development, good / bad practices about coding and different 
programming language, including : C#, Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. My strongest langauges being HTML and CSS.

I am currenctly studying JSX and React library, and working to create my own website using the React library. I'm also familiar with the Bootstrap
library on HTML.

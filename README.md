**_What I'm currenctly working towards_**

I am currently studying on a web development course created by Meta and hosted by Coursera. This course includes the introduction to HTML, CSS and JS code, along with learning
and taking a deep dive into libraries such as Boostrap and React. I am currenctly working and studying about the React library, and how to use it to make personalised web applications.

**_Fun facts about me_** 
--
- Building Computers is something I really enjoy duing. I have build my very own system to withstand anything I need it to do. Besidest that I've also helped others around me such as family and
  friends to build their own, whether it was just recommending specific hardware or building it for them.
- Besides computers and software, I love anything to do with business and finances, as I find it facinating how our system works, and how business operate. This love for business started in school as well,
  and got carried out of school to me just doing it on my own, in my free time, reading books or watching videos about how the financial system opertes, how businesses operate and how money works in general.
